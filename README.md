# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early prediction of diabetes can help in managing and preventing complications. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on various medical attributes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains medical data for 768 female patients of Pima Indian heritage. The dataset includes the following attributes:

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age (years)
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1), indicating whether the patient has diabetes
